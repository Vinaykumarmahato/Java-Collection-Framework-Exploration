         * We learn about maps in Java.
         * A map is an interface.
         * It's like a tool we can use to manage data efficiently.
         * Maps are helpful when we need to find, update, or delete elements based on a key.
         * For example, if we have a list of items and each item has a unique identifier (like a name or ID), 
         * a map can help us quickly locate, modify, or remove items based on their identifiers.
