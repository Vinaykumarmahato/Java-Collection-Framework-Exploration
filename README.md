## Why Collection

Collections in Java are used to store, retrieve, and manipulate groups of objects. They provide a way to efficiently manage and organize data in various data structures.

## Collection Hierarchy

The Collection interface in Java represents a group of objects known as elements. It is the root interface of the Java Collection Framework hierarchy.

## ArrayList

ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface. It provides dynamic resizing, fast random access, and allows duplicate elements.

## LinkedList

LinkedList is a doubly linked list implementation of the List interface. It provides fast insertion and deletion operations, but slower random access.

## ArrayDeque

ArrayDeque is a resizable-array implementation of the Deque interface. It supports both FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) operations efficiently.

## PriorityQueue

PriorityQueue is an unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap. It orders elements based on their natural ordering or a specified comparator.

## TreeSet

TreeSet is a NavigableSet implementation based on a Red-Black tree. It maintains elements in sorted order and allows efficient retrieval of elements.

## HashSet and LinkedHashSet

HashSet is an implementation of the Set interface that uses a hash table for storage. LinkedHashSet is a subclass of HashSet that maintains insertion order.

## Iterator and ListIterator

Iterator and ListIterator are interfaces used to traverse elements in a collection. Iterator is used for forward traversal, while ListIterator provides bidirectional traversal in lists.

## FailFast Vs FailSafe

Fail-Fast and Fail-Safe iterators are two types of iterators used in Java collections. Fail-Fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException if the collection is modified during iteration, whereas Fail-Safe iterators do not.

## Introduction to Map

A Map in Java is a collection that maps keys to values. Each key is unique, and it can be used to retrieve its corresponding value efficiently.

## Map Hierarchy

The Map interface is the root interface of the Java Map hierarchy. It defines the basic methods for manipulating key-value pairs.

## HashMap and LinkedHashMap

HashMap is an implementation of the Map interface that uses hashing to store key-value pairs. LinkedHashMap is a subclass of HashMap that maintains insertion order.

## Accessing Objects in Map

You can access objects in a Map using the get() method by providing the corresponding key. It returns the value associated with the specified key, or null if the key is not found.

## Inbuilt Classes in Map Hierarchy

Java provides several inbuilt classes in the Map hierarchy, including TreeMap, WeakHashMap, IdentityHashMap, and ConcurrentHashMap, each with its specific characteristics and use cases.

## HashMap Vs WeakHashMap

HashMap is a general-purpose implementation of the Map interface, whereas WeakHashMap is a specialized implementation that allows its keys to be garbage collected if they are not referenced elsewhere.

## Generics in Java

Generics in Java enable the creation of classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on parameterized types. They provide type safety and reduce the need for explicit type casting.

## Collection Class and its Inbuilt Methods

The Collection class in Java provides various utility methods for working with collections, such as sorting, searching, and bulk operations like adding or removing multiple elements.
